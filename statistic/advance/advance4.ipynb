    "A t-test is used when the sample size is small, and the population variance is unknown. It assumes that the population follows a normal distribution. A t-test calculates the t-statistic by comparing the difference between the sample means to the variation within the samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario for a t-test:\n",
    "Suppose we want to compare the average heights of two groups of students, Group A and Group B. We collect a small sample of students from each group (e.g., 20 students per group) and measure their heights. As the sample sizes are relatively small, and we do not know the population variances, we would use a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the average heights between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "A z-test, on the other hand, is used when the sample size is large (typically above 30) or when the population variance is known. It also assumes that the population follows a normal distribution. A z-test calculates the z-score by comparing the difference between the sample means to the known population variance.\n",

    "Let's say we want to determine if a new weight-loss program is effective. We randomly select a large sample of individuals (e.g., 500 participants) and measure their weights before and after the program. Since the sample size is large and assuming the population variance is known or the Central Limit Theorem applies, we can use a z-test to compare the mean weights before and after the program and determine if there is a significant difference."

However, due to a random variation in the data or other factors, the statistical test results lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis, indicating that the drug is effective.

The null hypothesis (H0) states that the treatment has no effect. However, due to factors like small sample size or weak treatment effect, the statistical test fails to reject the null hypothesis. As a result, the researcher concludes that the treatment is ineffective, even though it might have some effect. This leads to a Type 2 error, a false negative conclusion."
