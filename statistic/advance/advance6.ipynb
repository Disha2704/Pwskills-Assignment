    "\n",
    "Complete Case Analysis (CCA): This method involves excluding cases with missing data from the analysis. The analysis is then conducted only on the available complete cases. The consequence of CCA is a potential loss of statistical power and bias if the missing data is not completely at random (MCAR). The results may only represent a subset of the original sample and may not accurately reflect the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairwise Deletion: With pairwise deletion, missing data are excluded on a variable-by-variable basis. Each variable is analyzed separately, and cases with missing data on that specific variable are omitted from the analysis for that variable only. This approach maximizes the available data for each variable, but it can lead to biased estimates if the missingness is related to the outcome or predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputation: Imputation involves replacing missing values with estimated values based on certain assumptions or models. Common imputation methods include mean imputation, regression imputation, and multiple imputation. Imputation allows for the use of all available data, preserves sample size, and reduces bias. However, it assumes that the imputation model is correctly specified, which can introduce additional uncertainty into the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of missing data handling method depends on the nature of the missing data and the assumptions made about the missingness mechanism. It is important to carefully consider the potential consequences of different methods, such as bias, loss of power, and incorrect inferences. Researchers should also report the missing data handling approach used and evaluate the robustness of the results by conducting sensitivity analyses using different methods if possible.\n",
